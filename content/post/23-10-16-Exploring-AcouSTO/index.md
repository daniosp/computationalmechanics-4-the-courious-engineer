While searching for an approach to acoustics as a Mechanical Engineer student, the open-source software AcouSTO was presented to me as an alternative to learn while doing simulations.

# Â¿What is AcouSTO? 

<p align="justify">
AcouSTO is an open-source software for acoustic simulation released in 2009. The project was developed as a Boundary Element Method (BEM) solver for the Kirchhoff-Helmholtz Integral Equation (KHIE) within domains of arbitrary geometry. Although many open-source software alternatives for the simulation of multiple physics phenomenon were available at the time, AcouSTO emerged as an acoustic-centered proposal capable of handling both interior an exterior problems whilst being a relatively simple tool to use for the averaged experienced user.
