While searching for an approach to acoustics as a Mechanical Engineer student, the open-source software AcouSTO was presented to me as an alternative to learn while doing simulations.

AcouSTO is an open-source software for acoustic simulation released in 2009. The project was developed as a Boundary Element Method (BEM) solver for the Kirchhoff-Helmholtz Integral Equation (KHIE) within domains of arbitrary geometry. It emerged as an acoustic-centered proposal within the public-domain-software era
